# C# Practice Projects

A collection of short, focused C# mini-projects designed to strengthen my understanding of language fundamentals — from variables and loops to inheritance and collections.

Each project can be completed in about **1–2 hours** and focuses on a specific set of C# concepts.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Practice turning **requirements into working code**
- Strengthen understanding of:
  - Variables, types, and scope
  - Control flow (if/else, loops, switch)
  - Object-oriented programming (classes, methods, inheritance)
  - Collections (`List`, `Dictionary`)
  - Enums, static members, and null handling
  - Working with `DateTime`
